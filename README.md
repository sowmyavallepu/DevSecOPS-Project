## üéÆProject Overview and Objectives
Secure DevSecOPS Pipeline for Infinite Mario Game
This project focuses on building a secure, automated DevSecOps pipeline to streamline the development, security, and deployment lifecycle of the Infinite Mario JavaScript game. It showcases the complete DevSecOps workflow, incorporating code quality checks, security scans, and automated container deployments within a Kubernetes environment. By implementing a robust CI/CD process, the pipeline ensures proactive vulnerability detection, efficient and secure deployments, and a resilient, cloud-based infrastructure optimized for adaptability and scalability.
# üõ†Ô∏è This project Aims to Deliver:
- **Automated Code Quality and Security:** Integration with SonarQube for Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to detect potential security issues early.
-**Container Security:** Use of Grype and other tools to scan container images for vulnerabilities.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC):** Efficient deployment within Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
- **Continuous Deployment:** Leveraging GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD workflows, ensuring rapid and reliable releases.
