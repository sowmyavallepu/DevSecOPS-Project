# **DevSecOps Pipeline for Super Mario Game: Real-Time Project Integration**  ![DevSecOps](https://img.shields.io/badge/DevSecOps-Real--Time--Integration-blue?style=flat&logo=git)

## **Introduction**  ![Project Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Super_Mario_Game-blue?style=flat&logo=docker)

In this project, we demonstrate how a **DevSecOps pipeline** works in the context of a real-world application — the **Super Mario Game**. This pipeline integrates various **previous labs** and showcases how everything runs in a **real-time scenario** for a complete **enterprise application**. We've combined all the essential steps of the DevSecOps process, from secure code commits to automated deployments and monitoring.

Our goal is to understand how real-time applications like Super Mario can benefit from modern **DevSecOps** practices, ensuring code quality, security, and smooth deployments in an automated manner.

## **What We Achieved in Previous Labs**  ![Achievement Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Achievements-Completed-yellow)

Throughout our previous labs, we worked on several key components that now come together in this **real-time project**:

1. **Setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions**:
   - We created automated workflows for building, testing, and deploying the Super Mario Game.
   - We integrated **SonarQube** for Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to catch security vulnerabilities early.

2. **Containerizing the Application**:
   - The Super Mario Game was containerized using **Docker**. We built a Docker image of the game and pushed it to **Docker Hub** for distribution.

3. **Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - We used **Grype** to scan the Docker image for security vulnerabilities, ensuring that no critical issues exist before deployment.

4. **Version Control & GitOps**:
   - We employed **GitOps** principles to manage application deployment, using **ArgoCD** for continuous deployment.
   - The updated Docker image tag and version were automatically pushed to the **Kubernetes deployment YAML**.

## **Real-Time DevSecOps Pipeline Workflow**  ![Pipeline](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pipeline-Real--Time--Flow-brightgreen)

The pipeline is designed to **automate** the following stages for every code change and deployment:

### **1. Code Change & Trigger**  ![Code Change](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stage-Code_Change-orange)
   - When we make a **code change** (e.g., adjusting game controls), the pipeline is triggered automatically.

### **2. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**  ![SonarQube](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-SonarQube-blueviolet)
   - **SonarQube** analyzes the code to identify any security vulnerabilities and code quality issues, ensuring that we are shipping secure and high-quality code.

### **3. Docker Image Build & Push**  ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-Docker-blue?style=flat&logo=docker)
   - The pipeline builds a **Docker image** from the latest code changes.
   - The image is pushed to **Docker Hub**, tagged with the current version of the game.

### **4. Container Image Vulnerability Scan**  ![Vulnerability Scan](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-Grype-green?style=flat&logo=docker)
   - After the Docker image is built, it undergoes a **vulnerability scan** using **Grype** to ensure there are no critical security issues in the image before deployment.

### **5. Update Deployment Files**  ![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-Kubernetes-blue?style=flat&logo=kubernetes)
   - The **deployment YAML file** and **version.txt** are updated with the new Docker image tag and version, ensuring future deployments use the correct image.

### **6. Continuous Deployment with ArgoCD**  ![ArgoCD](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-ArgoCD-lightgray?style=flat&logo=argo)
   - **ArgoCD** detects the updated image tag in the GitHub repository and automatically syncs the changes with the **Kubernetes cluster**.
   - This ensures the latest version of the game is running in the production environment.

## **How It Works: Real-Time Integration of Previous Labs**  ![Integration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Integration-Complete-success)

In this project, we take the **learnings from all previous labs** and integrate them into a cohesive, **end-to-end DevSecOps pipeline** for the **Super Mario Game**:

- **Previous Lab 1: GitHub Actions & CI/CD**  
  We set up automated workflows using **GitHub Actions** to trigger builds, tests, and deployments whenever code changes are pushed to the repository.
  
- **Previous Lab 2: Dockerization**  
  The Super Mario Game was containerized into a Docker image, ensuring that the game can be deployed in different environments with consistent results.

- **Previous Lab 3: Security Scanning**  
  We integrated **SonarQube** for static code analysis and **Grype** for Docker image vulnerability scanning to identify and address security issues early in the pipeline.

- **Previous Lab 4: Kubernetes & GitOps**  
  We used **ArgoCD** for continuous deployment and **Kubernetes** for orchestrating the application in the cloud. The deployment YAML and version files are updated automatically, keeping everything in sync with the latest changes.

## **Real-Time Project Insights**  ![Insights](https://img.shields.io/badge/Insights-Real--Time-green)

### **End-to-End Integration**

By integrating all the steps we’ve covered in our labs, we can see how they work in a **real-time project**:

- The **GitHub Actions** workflow automatically triggers on code changes, running security scans with **SonarQube**.
- The pipeline then **builds** and **pushes** the updated **Super Mario Docker image** to **Docker Hub**.
- The **Grype vulnerability scan** ensures the image is secure before deployment.
- The **Kubernetes deployment YAML file** is updated with the new version of the image, and the deployment is automatically updated in the **Kubernetes cluster** using **ArgoCD**.

### **Real-Time Application of DevSecOps**

This project demonstrates how an application like **Super Mario Game** can go from code change to secure deployment with **DevSecOps practices**:

- **Automation** at every stage ensures that code is tested, built, scanned, and deployed with minimal human intervention.
- **Security** is embedded throughout the process, from SAST to container image vulnerability scanning, ensuring that we deliver secure code at every step.
- **GitOps** ensures consistency and visibility in deployments, allowing us to easily roll back changes or deploy new features quickly.

## **Conclusion**  ![Success](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Success-green)

This project provides a **real-time demonstration** of how the **DevSecOps pipeline** works for an enterprise-grade application like the **Super Mario Game**. By integrating everything we’ve built in our previous labs, we’ve created a **robust and secure pipeline** that automates the entire process from code change to deployment, ensuring quality and security at every stage.

This pipeline not only saves time but also ensures that the game is always up-to-date, secure, and ready for deployment in a production environment, following the principles of **DevSecOps** and **GitOps**.
